Clean up your WordPress admin area by hiding most ads, review nags and promo banners while keeping real warnings and errors visible.

== Description ==

Many plugins flood your wp-admin with:

* "Go Pro / Upgrade" boxes
* Black Friday / Cyber Monday sales
* "Please rate us 5-stars" notices

**Clean Admin – Hide Dashboard Ads** quietly removes that noise so you can focus on your work.

What it does:

* Hides most dashboard promo widgets and sale banners
* Hides annoying "Rate us / Leave a review" nags
* Hides common plugin promo boxes on settings pages
* Keeps core error/warning notices visible
* Simple options page under **Settings → Clean Admin**
* Supports translations via `clean-admin` text domain
* Custom promo/review keyword lists for power users
* Settings reset to defaults with one click
* Shows a quick activation notice with direct Settings link

This plugin only runs in `wp-admin` and does not affect your frontend.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `clean-admin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install via the Plugins → Add New screen.
2. Activate **Clean Admin – Hide Dashboard Ads** through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **Settings → Clean Admin** and choose which types of notices to hide.
4. (Optional) Add your own keywords in the advanced settings to hide more promo/review texts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this affect my site frontend? =

No. Clean Admin only runs in the WordPress admin area (`/wp-admin`).

= Will it hide core error messages? =

The plugin tries to keep anything that looks like a real error or warning (for example WordPress core error notices).
It mainly targets promotional, upsell, and review messages.

= Can this break a plugin? =

It only hides UI elements with CSS/JS based on their text content and classes.
It does not disable hooks or remove code, so in normal cases it should not break functionality.

= Does it support Elementor / similar plugins? =

Yes, Clean Admin can hide many Elementor / ElementsKit / other plugin promo boxes and review nags, but it cannot guarantee 100% coverage for every plugin.

= Where is the Settings link? =

On the Plugins page, there is a direct **Settings** link under Clean Admin, or go to **Settings → Clean Admin**.

== Advanced Usage ==

= Custom Keywords =

You can add your own keywords to hide specific promotions or review requests. For example:

* To hide "Early Bird" offers: add `early bird` to **Custom Promo Keywords**.
* To hide "Beta Tester" requests: add `beta tester` to **Custom Review Keywords**.

Each field accepts a comma-separated list of phrases. Matching is done in a simple "contains text" way, case-insensitive.

= Hooks for Developers =

You can filter the default keyword lists using these filters:

* `caa_promo_words` – filter the default promo words array.
* `caa_review_words` – filter the default review words array.

Example:

`add_filter( 'caa_promo_words', function( $words ) { $words[] = 'early bird'; return $words; } );`
