# Bros Clean Admin – Hide Dashboard Ads

**Bros Clean Admin** is a lightweight WordPress plugin that cleans up your `wp-admin` area by hiding most ads, review messages and promo banners, while keeping real warnings and errors visible.  

Power users can also define their own custom promo/review keywords to hide, and developers can hook into the keyword lists via simple filters.
